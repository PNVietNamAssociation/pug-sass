// The main file (usually labelled main.scss) should be the only Sass file from
// the whole code base not to begin with an underscore.
// This file should not contain anything but @import and comments.
// In order to preserve readability, the main file should respect these guidelines:
// - one file per @import;
// - one @import per line;
// - no new line between two imports from the same folder;
// - a new line after the last import from a folder;
// - file extensions and leading underscores omitted.
